# Multi-cloud-architecture-project-Azure-and-aws-
Multi-Cloud Architecture Team to design, implement, test, and deploying a multi-tier web-based architecture using Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS) to host a WordPress website.
## 🔍 Overview
This repository contains a complete, well-documented example project that demonstrates a hybrid multi-cloud architecture connecting **Azure** and **AWS**.  
Azure is used for identity, DNS and monitoring, while AWS hosts the application and database. A site-to-site VPN provides secure private connectivity between the two clouds.

## 📁 What is in this repo
- diagram – architecture diagrams (included image)
- azure – Terraform skeletons, scripts and example policies
- aws – Terraform skeletons, Lambda backup script and IAM policies
- vpn – VPN configuration templates and OpenVPN setup guide
- monitoring – monitoring and alerting guides for Azure & AWS
- docs – a detailed step-by-step setup guide you can follow and share


## 🔐 Important: Secrets & State files
- DO NOT commit Terraform state files (`*.tfstate`), provider credentials, or any files that include secrets.
- Use .gitignore to exclude sensitive files (this repo includes a `.gitignore`).

## 🧭 Next steps
1. Open `docs/step-by-step-setup.md` — follow it to deploy components into Azure and AWS.
2. Customize the Terraform variables in `azure/terraform/` and `aws/terraform/`.
3. Set up the VPN following `vpn/azure-vpn-gateway-config.txt` and `vpn/aws-vpn-customer-gateway-config.txt`.
4. Configure monitoring and alerts using files under `monitoring/`.
